Greetings,

This project encodes data in the form of subcarrier erasing and transmits the data along with the regular WiFi traffic. The regular WiFi channel, referred to as main channel, will not suffer performance degradation. The extra data throughput can be used to deliver delay-sensitive traffic.

This project is built upon GNURadio/USRP platform. The project is built upon project IEEE802.11 PHY (https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11/).
