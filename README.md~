Greetings,

This project encodes data in the form of subcarrier erasing and transmits the data along with the regular WiFi traffic.

This project is built upon GNURadio/USRP platform. The project implements the complete IEEE802.11 protocol, which includes PHY (Based on 2), MAC (Based on 3)), and rate adaptation approaches. The rate adaptation approaches includes Minstrel and Adaptive Auto Rate Fallback (AARF).
